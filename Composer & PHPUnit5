COMPOSER INSTALLATION ON LINUX

1) The installation of Composer on a Linux server is simple and straightforward. All you have to do is download and install the Composer by executing the following command:

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

The installation may require a few seconds to complete.

 

2) You need to make the ‘composer.phar’ file executable by running the following command :

chmod +x composer.phar

 

3) Run the following command to make Composer globally available for all system users:

mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

 

4) That’s it! You have now installed Composer on your Linux server and made it globally available for all users. You can verify the installation by checking Composer version. Run the following command to confirm the Composer installation.

composer -V
